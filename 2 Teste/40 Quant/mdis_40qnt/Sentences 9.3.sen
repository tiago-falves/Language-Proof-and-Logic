; It looks like Bozo is trying to say that a small
; cube named a is in front of a tetrahedron named e./x(SameCol(x, b))(Cube(a) & Cube(b)) | Cube(c)
; There are two different ways of adding 
; parentheses that can turn this into a sentence. Cube(a) % (Cube(b) % Cube(e))/x ~(Cube (x))/y (Cube(y) & Small(y))
; Bozo wants to say that there is a small cube./x (Cube(x) & Small(x))
; Bozo tries again to say that there is a small cube.~/y (Dodec(y) & Large(y))
; Bozo left out a negation sign.  There are four
; places you could put it, but one would make the
; sentence false.@y (Cube(y) $ ~Medium(y))@x ((Tet(x) & Small(x)) $ FrontOf(x, e))s=117923;
